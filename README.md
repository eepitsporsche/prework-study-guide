# My Pre-work Study Guide Webpage

## Description

As a bootcamp student and novice coder, it is critical to have a repository in which to store and organize notes. This pre-work study guide serves as a journal to note relevant information during the coding course.
This journal contains information to remind and reinforce key terms and topics necessary to begin the bootcamp course.
Construction of this webpage introduces bootcamp students to each of the building blocks of coding applications (HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript).
