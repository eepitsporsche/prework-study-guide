# My Pre-work Study Guide Webpage

## Description

As a novice coder, it is critical that I have a repository in which to store and organize notes. This pre-work study guide serves as a journal to note relevant information during my coding course.

Through construction of this webpage, I have been introduced to each of the building blocks of coding applications.
